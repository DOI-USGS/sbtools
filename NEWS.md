# Version 0.17.1 (2016-04-10)

* Improved version of `query_sb()` now requests useful metadata so
`sbitem` list has key metadata

# Version 0.17.0 (2016-04-10)

* On `item_replace_files()` changed default on `all` flag to FALSE
so it doesn't delete files by default.

* Added `item_rename_files()` to enable user to easily 
rename files attached to items directly.
