\section{Summary}

As many real-world projects have demonstrated, R is
an excellent tool for collaborative and reproducible
research projects \citep{Gandrud213}. But more flexible and powerful
ways to share and collaborate around common datasets
are a missing component. To help fill this gap, we
have created \pkg{sbtools}. The \pkg{sbtools} package
gives the user programmatic access to the
cloud-based data and metadata storage of USGS ScienceBase
and allows all researchers direct query and download
capabilities to free, public data on ScienceBase.
\pkg{sbtools} enables rapid and reproducible
access to one of the single
largest repositories of earth-science data and an advanced
cloud-based data collaboration platform.
