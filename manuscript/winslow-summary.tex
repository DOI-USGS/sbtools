\section{Summary}

As many real-world projects have demonstrated, R is
an excellent tool for collaborative and reproducible
research projects \citep{Gandrud2013}. New packages are
frequently opening up access to large, open datasets 
\citep{rNOMADS, rFDSN}. Flexible and powerful
ways to share and collectively work with common datasets
could enable new modes of collaboration and diverse data discovery.
To help fill this gap, we have created \pkg{sbtools}. 
The \pkg{sbtools} package gives the user programmatic access to the
cloud-based data and metadata storage of USGS ScienceBase
and allows all researchers direct query and download
capabilities to free, public data on ScienceBase.
\pkg{sbtools} enables rapid and reproducible
access to one of the single
largest repositories of Earth-science data and an advanced
cloud-based data collaboration platform.
