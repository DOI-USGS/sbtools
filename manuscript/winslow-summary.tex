\section{Summary}

As many real-world project have demonstrated, R is 
an excellent tool for collaborative and reproducible 
research projects. But more flexible and powerful
ways to share and collaborate around common datasets
are a missing component. To help fill this gap, we 
have created \pkg{sbtools}. The \pkg{sbtools} package
gives the R environment programmatic access to the 
cloud-based data and metadata storage of USGS ScienceBase 
and allows all researchers direct query and download 
capabilities to free, open USGS federal data sources. 
With its release, \pkg{sbtools} provides advanced
functionality for access to the one of the single 
largest repositories of earth-science data and an advanced 
cloud-based data collaboration platform.
