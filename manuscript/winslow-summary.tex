\section{Summary}

As many real-world project have demonstrated, R is 
an excellent tool for collaborative and reproducible 
research projects. But more flexible and powerful
ways to share and collaborate around common datasets
are a missing component. To help fill this gap, we 
have created \pkg{sbtools}, giving R direct access to 
available datasets and the expansive data collaboration 
capabilities of USGS ScienceBase. \pkg{sbtools} 
allows all researchers query and access capabilities 
to free, open USGS federal data sources. Furthermore, 
it enables USGS researchers and collaborators direct 
access to cloud-based data and metadata storage. With 
this functionality, ScienceBase and \pkg{sbtools} offers
new, cloud-based support of scientific data workflows and 
direct access to one of the largest single repositories 
of federally-collected earth science data.



\begin{itemize}
	\item{Building tools to improve data access and handling for collaborative projects will be important in the future}
	\item{sbtools gives users direct access to a large collection of USGS data}
	\item{It also links online data storage directly to R workflows}
	\item{With the popularity and power of the R universe growing, opening access to data, along with code online will be important}
