	abstract = {The author introduces a set of integrated developments in Web application software, networking, data citation standards, and statistical methods designed to increase scholarly recognition for data contributions; to put some of the universe of data and data-sharing practices on firmer ground; and to facilitate the public distribution of persistent, authorized, and verifiable data, with powerful and easy-to-use technology, even when the data are confidential or proprietary. The goal is to solve some of the political and sociological problems of data sharing via technological means, with the result intended to benefit both the scientific community and the sometimes apparently contradictory goals of individual researchers.},

@article{dataone,
	abstract = {The scope and nature of biological and environmental research are evolving in response to environmental challenges such as global climate change, invasive species and emergent diseases. In particular, scientific studies are increasingly focusing on long-term, broad-scale, and complex questions that require massive amounts of diverse data collected by remote sensing platforms and embedded environmental sensor networks; collaborative, interdisciplinary science teams; and new approaches for managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing data. Here, we describe the design of DataONE (Data Observation Network for Earth)-a cyberinfrastructure platform developed to support rapid data discovery and access across diverse data centers distributed worldwide and designed to provide scientists with an integrated set of familiar tools that support all elements of the data life cycle (e.g., from planning and acquisition through data integration, analysis and visualization). Ongoing evolution of the DataONE architecture is based on participatory, user-centered design processes including: (1) identification and prioritization of stakeholder communities; (2) developing an understanding of their perceptions, attitudes and user requirements; (3) usability analysis and assessment; and (4) engaging science teams in grand challenge exemplars such as understanding the broad-scale dynamics of bird migration. In combination, the four approaches engage the broad community in providing guidance on infrastructure design and implementation. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
