\title{\pkg{sbtools}: A package connecting R to cloud-based data for collaborative online research}
\author{by Luke A Winslow, Scott Chamberlain, Alison Appling and Jordan Read}

\maketitle

\abstract{
Among environmental science researchers, the adoption of high-quality tools
for collaboration and reproducibile research such as R and Github is becoming 
more common. While Github and other version management systems are excellent 
resources, they were originally designed to handle code and scale poorly to 
large text-based or binary datasets. To handle collaborative workflows using 
using existing published and large scientific datasets, there is increasing 
need to connect cloud-based online data storage to R. In this article, we 
introduce the U.S. Geological Survey's online data archive, ScienceBase, and 
describe how \pkg{sbtools} enables direct access to cloud-based USGS data.
