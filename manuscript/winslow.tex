\section{The need for collaborative storage}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Creating powerful and useful tools to open and accelerate science an important issue of our time}
	\item{One rapidly emerging area is reproducibile research and data archiving}
	\item{These goals primarily focus creating more useful, open, and accessible products of research}
	\item{But data- and code-intensive collaborative projects increasingly need collaborative solutions for data storage, sharing, and updating throughout the project lifecycle}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Active collaborations have different needs}
	\item{Need large-file storage and access, Mixture of public and controlled access, programmatic access to retrieving data and updating results}
	\item{}
	
\end{itemize}

\end{example}
