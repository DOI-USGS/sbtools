\maketitle

\abstract{
The adoption of high-quality tools
for collaboration and reproducibile research such as R and Github is becoming 
more common in many research fields. 
While Github and other version management systems are excellent 
resources, they were originally designed to handle code and scale poorly to 
large text-based or binary datasets. A number of scientific data repositories 
are coming online and are often focused on dataset archival and publication. 
To handle collaborative workflows using large scientific datasets, there is increasing 
need to connect cloud-based online data storage to R. In this article, we 
describe how the new R package \pkg{sbtools} enables direct access to the advanced online data 
functionality provided by ScienceBase, the U.S. Geological Survey's online scientific data storage
platform.
