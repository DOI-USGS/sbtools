\section{Introduction}

Cloud data storage platforms can be a powerful tool for research collaboration,
distributed computing, and data publication. However, while browser-based graphical
interfaces make these platforms accessible to a wide audience, there is also
a strong need for scripted data handling so that researchers can rigorously
document data provenance and create reproducible analyses. For example,
Figshare \cidep{figshare}, DataOne \cidep{dataone}, and Dataverse \cidep{dataverse} 
are all research data
sharing platforms gaining use in different research fields. For each of these
platforms, the community has released \citep{rfigshare, dvn} or is
developing \citep{dataone} R packages to streamline the storage and access
to archived data.

These existing projects primarily focus on creating more useful, open, and
accessible the end products of research. But data- and code-intensive collaborative projects
increasingly need collaborative solutions for data storage, sharing, and updating
not just at the end of the project, but throughout the full project lifecycle. 
Furthermore, many of these data
archive platforms focus on academic research projects and do not support some
of the unique needs of federal research. For example, many government institutions
require an archived copy of released data to be stored and available through federally
owned websites, not just a third party storage provider.

To address future scientific data sharing and archival challenges, the USGS
created ScienceBase (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/). This platform is
designed to support
the full project data lifecycle and has seen rapid adoption with USGS
researchers and collaborators. ScienceBase supports the storage and access
of large files and datasets. It allows data to be stored with a user-configurable 
mixture of
public and controlled access and has been designed from the beginning with
first-class RESTful web interfaces to support robust API access. Items on ScienceBase 
can have hierarchical relationships, facilitating the organization of complex or related
data. It also allows
a seamless transition from project development to data publication, with
a focus on complete metadata description, search and public data access once 
data have been released.

To expand the usefulness of the ScienceBase platform directly to R workflows, 
we have designed and
implemented an R interface to ScienceBase called \pkg{sbtools} (\cite{sbtools}).
This interface provides scripted R access to ScienceBase to manage metadata and
data files, to search the catalog of datasets, and to view and modify data in
formats familiar to R users.
Here we describe unique and useful features of ScienceBase, and how we have
implemented the R interface to make them accessible and useful from R.
